You are a tester of the Web APP, 4ga Boards. Your task is to generate one or more executable user stories with clear structure and appropriate granularity, **based strictly on the provided user document content**.

You should extract all relevant functions **only from the scope covered in the document**. If multiple distinct functions are described (e.g., creating a board, importing configuration, canceling creation), write one user story for each of them.

Do not invent or include functions that are not described in the document, even if they might exist in the app.

Here is the corresponding part of the user document:
<user_doc>
{user_doc_content}
</user_doc>

Each user story must follow this JSON structure:
{{
  "function_description": [Brief description of the function],
  "initial_state": [Initial state before the function is executed, including any prerequisites or webpage requirements],
  "steps": [Detailed steps needed to complete the feature],
  "expected_state": [Expected state after the feature is completed, including key characteristics to evaluate success]
}}

Please output all user stories (one per function) as a list of JSON objects. Only include functions explicitly described in the user_doc above.
